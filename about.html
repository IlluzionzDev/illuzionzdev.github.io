          <p>My name is Jamin Stratford. I'm a 14 year old developer from New Zealand who's passionate about coding.
            I've mainly worked around Spigot MC but have branched into other development areas.
            I now work with many languages and frameworks, and cover aspects such as Software Development,
            Web Development, and Game Development.
          </p>
          <p>I always had an interest in games and design,
            and roblox was a game that sparked that. I remember being intrigued in the Developer Studio they had
            and started to teach myself LUA. Lua was a easy language to learn, and really got me into programming. 
            A couple years later when I started to play Minecraft, I became interested in how the servers worked. From here, I started to
            develop an interest in Spigot, which is a server-side software for minecraft to run servers. At this point,
            backend was something I enjoyed developing and took time to research servers and how to code the plugins that
            run the server. Spigot and their plugins were coded in Java, so this is where I picked up an interest in
            Java. From here I learned more and more about Spigot, and more and more about Java. This happened about
            2 years ago, which means I have been actively learning about programming for about 2 years.
            </p>
            <p>From then, I have showed alot more interest in other programming things, such as Web Development, and Game Development.
              I have taught myself many more languages and frameworks, and continue to develop programs and plugins to this day.
