      <div class="about-content">
        <p>I'm <em>Jamin</em>, 15 year old passionate developer from <em>New Zealand</em>.</p>

        <p>I've mainly worked around <em>SpigotMC</em> but have branched into other development areas. 
          I now work with many languages and frameworks, and cover aspects such as <em>Software Development</em>, <em>Web Development</em>, and <em>Game Developement</em>.</p>

        <p>I always had an interest in games and design, and roblox was a game that sparked that. 
          I remember being intrigued in the Developer Studio they had and started to teach myself LUA. 
          Lua was a easy language to learn, and really got me into programming. 
          A couple years later when I started to play Minecraft, I became interested in how the servers worked. 
          From here, I started to develop an interest in Spigot, which is a server-side software for minecraft to run servers. </p>

        <p>At this point, backend was something I enjoyed developing and took time to research servers and how to code the plugins that run the server. 
            Spigot and their plugins were coded in Java, so this is where I picked up an interest in Java. 
            From here I learned more and more about Spigot, and more and more about Java. 
            This happened about 2 years ago, which means I have been actively learning about programming for about 2 years.</p>
            
        <p>From then, I have showed alot more interest in other programming things, such as Web Development, and Game Development. 
          I have taught myself many more languages and frameworks, and continue to develop programs and plugins to this day.</p>
